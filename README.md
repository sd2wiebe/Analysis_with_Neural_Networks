## Overview of Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is 

## Results 

### Data Preprocessing:

<li>The target variable for our model is "IS_SUCCESSFUL".</li>
<li>Feature variables include: status, ask amount, application type, income amount, organization etc.</li>
<li>We removed variables that were neither targets nor features, such as "EIN" and "NAME".</li>

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model:

<li>For my optimized model I used 5 hidden layers with 25 neurons on each</li>
<li>With each additional hidden layer and as I added more neurons the accuracy improved slightly</li>
<li>Target performance was 75%, unfortunately I was only able to reach ~74.27%</li>
<li> I experimented with removing features, changing bucket sizes, changing activation functions on hidden layers and adding epochs </li>
